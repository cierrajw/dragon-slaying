# dragon-slaying

This is a program which will be an epic battle of hero vs. dragon. The hero will need to attack the dragon and defend herself from the dragon. 
In the program we are keeping track of the number of 'hitpoints' (whether or not the dragon/hero are alive) to see who will win this battle to the death.
